This Python application extracts worklogs from Jira using Jira's REST API (v3) within a specified date range. It provides detailed information on the time logged for various issues during the provided date range, simplifying the task of tracking worklogs for projects.

## Features
- Connects to Jira using Jira REST API v3.
- Fetches worklogs for specified date ranges.
- Filters worklogs by user.
- Export the results as CSV
  
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jira API access (API Token and credentials)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
	git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jira-worklog-extractor.git
	cd jira-worklog-extractor
```
    
2. **Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):**
```bash
	python -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies::**
```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```
-   Flask (for the web server)
-   Requests (for interacting with the Jira REST API)
-   pytz (for timezone management)
-   Jinja2 (for templating)
-   Gunicorn (for running the Flask app in production)

4. **Configuration:**
    Rename `config.json.template` to `config.json` and update the following content:
```json
	{
		"DEBUG": true,
		"APP_SECRET_KEY": "<YOUR_CUSTOM_APP_SECRET_KEY>",
		"LOG_FILE_NAME": "jira_app_logs.txt"
	}
```
- Set `APP_SECRET_KEY` to a custom secret key.
- `LOG_FILE_NAME` is the file where logs will be stored. This file is saved under `_logs` folder in the root directory

5. **Jira Setup:**
- You will need the following credentials to access Jiraâ€™s REST API:
- Jira Base URL (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net)
- Jira Username (email)

	2. Click on `Create API Token`
	3. Enter `Label` for this token
	4. Click on `Create`
	5. Copy Token **(you will not be able to see that beyond this dialog)**
	6. Store it securely and use this token to login

6. **Running the App**
You can run the app locally using Python:
```bash
	python app.py
```

7. **Access the Application**
Once the app is running, you can access it via http://localhost:5000
